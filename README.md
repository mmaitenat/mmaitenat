### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Maitena Tellaetxe Abete. When not at University, where I am pursuing a PhD in Computer Science, you will find me sharing time with my family and friends, whether itâ€™s through traveling to exotic places, cooking traditional dishes, trying new foods, rock-climbing... 
or perhaps dedicating time to myself by growing vegetables in my garden or reading a good book.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently finishing a PhD in Computer Science at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU where I have developed machine learning and optimization methods to solve the Clonal Deconvolution and Evolution Problem.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bayesian Statistics.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis projects, especially if it is biomedical data!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: maitenat@gmail.com
